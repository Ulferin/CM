\section{Project structure and notation}
The main aim of this project was to build two application models and apply different optimization methods for the implemented models.\newline
The models are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M1}: a neural network with piecewise-linear activation function, with possible regularization;
    \item \textbf{M2}: standard L\_2 linear regression
\end{itemize}
The methods to be applied to the models are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A1}: standard momentum descent approach applied to \textbf{M1};
    \item \textbf{A2}: deflected subgradient methods applied to \textbf{M1};
    \item \textbf{A3}: basic version of one of the direct linear least squares solvers (i.e. normal equations, QR, SVD) applied to \textbf{M2}.
\end{itemize}
In the following we will describe what are the main implementation choices and introduce some of the notation used in the rest of the report.\newline
As requested, the project requires to implement from scratch an \textit{Artificial Neural Network}, \textit{ANN} in the following and as referred in \cite{MLmitchell}, and a direct solver for the linear least square problem. The detailed description of the implemented methods will be given in the related sections of this document.
