\section{Methods}
This section gives detailed information about the required methods that will be implemented and applied to the models described in \S\ref{sec:ann} and \S\ref{sec:ls}. The main methods to be implemented are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard momentum descent approach applied to the \textit{ANN};
    \item Deflected subgradient method applied to the \textit{ANN};
    \item Direct linear least square solver applied to the \textit{Least Square problem}.
\end{itemize}
