\section{Introduction}
This report is about the project assigned for the course of Computational Mathematics for Learning and Data Analysis. All the work in this project is original content of the authors and is the result of the knowledge gathered from the courses of \textbf{ML} and \textbf{CM}. The report contents that are not directly work of the authors is well referenced and, as requested, we point to the references down to chapter and number of page.\newline

We start by giving a short description of the problem at hand and the methods used to solve it, including all the mathematical derivation needed to adapt the chosen methods to the problem. Next, we will give a brief recap of the expected results for the experiments, properties of the problem that suits our methods and details about the solvability of our problem with the used methods. In the end, we will show the achieved results, comparing them with the expected one describing which are the factors that determined a difference in the results.
